## Release Notes 4.2.0

## Changes

- **Tables Overview**:
  - Added optional column "Tutorials" also to the regular table overview. This way, users can easier see if there will be a tutorial available in the pause menu.
  - Improved ROM column: The tooltip of a ROM displays additional alias information now. In addition to that, you can use the table search field to filter games by their ROM name or alias.
  - Improved VPin MAME section: In addition to the alias mapping, the section shows also the tables which share the same ROM.
  - Responsive Toolbar: Since a lot of users use the Studio with a full HD monitor a second toolbar row has been added so that all toolbar actions are visible all time.
- **Table Imports**
  - The table import dialog has been improved. The file size is now shown too. Also, you can directly delete .vpx of .fp files so get rid of file corpses.
- **Pause Menu**
  - Added pause menu support for stand-alone mode of VPX.
- **Monitoring View / Screenshots**
  - Added a summary screenshot to the screenshot bundle which contains all screens as one image.
