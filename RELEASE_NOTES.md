## Release Notes 4.7.0

## Changes

- **Table Validators**: Introduced new table validator which checks if the table has a backglass, but the backglasses are disabled in the VPX settings. (I assume it is an edge case, but can be annoying to trouble-shoot).
- **ALT Color**: Added support for .cROMc files, which includes uploading, backup and backup on replace of .cROMc files.
