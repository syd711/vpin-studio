## Release Notes 3.15

## Changes

- **System Manager**: The overall update check is not blocking the UI anymore. This way, you can immediately switch to the other tabs now.

## Bugfixes

- **Drop-In Menu** Limited the amount of items to 100 to avoid a client crash when a folder with thousands of entries is added.
- **Drop-In Menu** Removed the system tray notification. It was ugly anyway.


## VPin Mania
