## Release Notes 3.12.6

## Changes

- **VPin Studio Server**: Added updating of launch and exit calls for VPX tables in PinballY.

---

## Release Notes 3.12.5

## Changes

- **MacOS Support**: The VPin Studio finally supports client installers for **x64 and arm**. Big shoutout to @gonzonia here!
- **Visual Pinball Backup Manager (VPBM)**: Updated to the newest version 3.5 (used for fresh installations).
- **Visual Pinball Backup Manager (VPBM) / Table Backups**: Removed the backup view from the Studio client and from the server. This way the server has no .net dependency anymore. VPBM is still available, but Studio does not intermingle with it's configuration anymore.
- **Table Views / Persistent Columns**: You can change the width and order (drag and drop) of columns and this state is saved now.
- **VPin Studio Client**: New pincab avatar used in client.
- **VPin Studio Client/Server**: Added possibility to change the default port from 8098 to another one. Consult the wiki help articles for more details.
- **VPin Studio Server**: Fixed update of start/exit curl calls in the emulator scripts which may have failed because of invalid SQL escaping.
- **VPin Studio Server**: Possible fix for the connection issues.
- **DMD Position Tool**: Support of full video for positioning from frontend when frontend menu screen is kept displayed
- **Server Performance Optimizations**: It is hard to put the results here in numbers, so they may vary depending on your machine. So here is what happened:
  - Some initialization processes like the lookup for resetted nvrams are executed asynchronous now, so that the server is faster available.  
  - PUP pack scanning: The media detection has been simplified, so the initial detection time is significantly faster.
  - ALT Sound scanning: Only if the validator is active, all ALT sound packages are precached. Otherwise they will be lazy loaded when opened in the "ALT Sound" section.

## Release Notes 3.12.4

## Changes

- **Installation**: Fixed **critical initial table scan bug** which sometimes corrupted the database so that the whole installation broke. For users where no tables where detected at all: just delete all files in the installation folder and restart the installation using the full installer .exe file.  
- **Highscore Resets**: Switched the default from 99 to 0. These values are only used when the highscore has been reset through the "Delete Table" dialog. 
- **Highscore Displays**: use client default thousands separator eveywhere when displaying scores, dashboard and player badges were not rendered properly 
- **VPin Studio Server**: Improved launch and exit curl calls. The curl call is replaced now with the additional parameter **emu** which contains additional information about the game emulator used, depending on the frontend you are using. This way, you can share your tables folder between different VPX emulators and the correct emulator is still detected corrected. The parameter is optional, so if the automatic update of the **curl** call fails for some reason, the old format is still valid. 
- **Highscore Settings**: Removed configuration option for highscore titles, e.g. "GRAND CHAMPION". These values are now part of the internal scoring database so that the user never has to deal with this kind of stuff.
- **Highscore Parsing**: Fixed highscores for tables **Defender, Black Pyramid and Catacomb**.
- **Highscore Parsing**: Fixed encoding problems when displaying highscore values with number separators. 
- **Tables / Playlists**: Renamed **Local Favorites** to **Playlist Favorites**.
- **Tables / PinVOL Settings**: The user interface for the PinVOL settings used the SSF DB limit value now. You can't configure this via Studio yet and have to configure it once via the PinVOL UI.
- **PinballX Frontend**: fixed zero byte download by using FTP passive mode, then try active mode if failure
- **System Manager**: Fixed **Backglass Server** update detection.

---

## Release Notes 3.12.3

## Changes

- **Tables / Asset Manager**: **Disabled auto-search for the asset manager and PinUP Popper**. It this was causing too much traffic. You have to hit "Search" manually from now on.
- **Tables / Backglasses**:  Support Alias Mapping for DMD Positioning.
- **VPin Mania / Online Status**: Again, improved check to set the online status back to "offline"/"online".
- **Tables / Highscores**: Added button to open the table on VPin Mania.
- **Tables / Locale Settings:** Removed the hard-coded "English" locale from the VPin Studio client. I don't why I've set this once, but depending on the country, the dot is shown as number separator again.
- **Competitions / iScored**: Added missing highscore reset for iScored subscriptions.
- **Tables / Media Recorder**: Added information how many videos have actually been recorded to the status and summary messages.
- **Pause Menu**: Fixed issue that the pause menu did not hide on table exit.
- **Pause Menu / Tutorial Videos**: Switched from **Chrome** to **Edge**. By default, **Microsoft Edge** will now be used for the tutorial playback via YouTube. This way, users don't have to install additional software.
- **Tables / Validations**: Switched back to a fix height for the validation error box to avoid accidental double-clicking the wrong table (avoids the table jumping when switching between valid and invalid tables).
- **Tables / Table Data Manager**: Switched the order of **Auto-Naming** and **VPS Entry** panels on the first tab. The renaming panel belongs closer to the actual fields it changes.
- **Tables / Launch Actions** When a table launched via Studio (through VPX.exe selection), the game status is set now. This allows the pause menu and in-game recording to work without the need to launch a game through the frontend.
- **Tables / PUP Pack Section**: Removed the PUP pack tweaker tool again as it is writing invalid configs for PinUP Popper.
- **Tables / PinVOL Settings**: Improved persistence layer to read/write only valid values. These may got broken due to the initial errorneous integration here.
- **Drop-In Folder**: The installation from the drop-in menu is now only allowed, when the table overview is selected. Otherwise, the table selection from the other views might lead to confusion.
