## Release Notes 4.1.0

## Changes

- **DMD Improvements**:
  - Improved parsing of script to detect usage of UltraDMD or FlexDMD and associated project folder.
  - Added validator to check DMD folder exists.
  - Refactored DMD tables sidebar to display DMD Type from script and associated DMD Folder.
  - **Note that you have to rescan the table or press the reload button in the DMD section to update the DMD information**.
- **ALT Color Backups**: Added dialog for ALT color backups. Note that you may already have some backups available since the actual backup support for the backend was already build a year ago. The dialog allows you to restore these files now.
