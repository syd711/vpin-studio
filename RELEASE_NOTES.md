## Release Notes 3.15

## Changes

- **System Manager**: The overall update check is not blocking the UI anymore. This way, you can immediately switch to the other tabs now.
- **Table Comments**: The comments dialog has been integrated into the Table Data Manager dialog. The feature was a bit too hidden.
- **Table Data Manager**: The Table Data Manager dialog has an additional tab "Playlists" now where the game can be assigned to playlists.
- **Highscore Backups**: Added bulk-operation support for highscore backups.

## Bugfixes

- **Drop-In Menu** Limited the amount of items to 100 to avoid a client crash when a folder with thousands of entries is added.
- **Drop-In Menu** Removed the system tray notification. It was ugly anyway.
