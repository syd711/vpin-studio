## Release Notes 3.6.0

## Changes

- **Data Exporter**: Added a new headless API (without UI) to export data in CSV format from the VPin Studio server. The usage of the API is documented here: https://github.com/syd711/vpin-studio/wiki/Data-Export. Note that this API is a first draft and likely to change, so don't consider it as stable yet in case you build your own tools based on it. Right now, it includes the following endpoints:
  - **Table Data Exporter**: Exports all table metadata of the selected tables.
  - **Highscore Exporter**: Exports all highscores of the selected tables.
  - **Backglass Exporter**: Exports the backglass metadata of the selected .directb2s files.
  - **Table Media Exporter**: Exports the number of media for available for every screen of the selected tables.

- **Highscore Card**: The canvas is centered automatically now  when no left/right margins are set.
- **Highscore Card**: The non-raw highscore list is centered automatically now when no left/right margins are set.
- **Windows VPin Studio Server Tray**: Added option to launch the Studio. The action is also executed on double-click on the tray icon.
- **Studio Client Toolbar**: Added mute/unmute option to system preferences drop-down menu.

## Bugfixes

- **Highscore Card Editor / Performance**: Fixed performance issue that the view caused to load all available games.
- **Highscore Card Editor / Fonts**: Fixed rendering of fonts. This one has been a flow right from the beginning. You finally get what you see when you select a font from the font selector, including the font weight and style. The issue that not all true-type-fonts (ttf files) have been rendered properly has been fixed too.
- **Table Uploads**: Deleting existing .vbs files on table replacements.
- **Smaller Screen Support**:
  - Fixed all views of the tables section to be useable for 1280x768.
  - The Studio window now has a minimum with of 1280x700 pixel.
  - Fixed navigation and header toolbar to be useable on smaller screen resolutions too.
- **Table Uploads / ALT Sound**: Fixed ALT Sound cancel upload.
