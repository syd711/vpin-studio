## Release Notes 4.3.0

## Changes

- **Table Backups**
  - The "Default Backups Folder" is not mandatory anymore and can be re-configured with another name and folder.
- **Folder Selections**
  - Added new dialog to select folders from the remote system. This allows the configurations at a lot of places now, where it only had been possible when the Studio was used on the cabinet itself.
