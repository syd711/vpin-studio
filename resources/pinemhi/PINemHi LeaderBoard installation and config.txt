WHAT IS PINEMHI LEADERBOARD ?
-----------------------------
PINemHi LeaderBoard is a program that catches the score and specialscores from player 1
The normal score doesn't have to be on the hiscore table of the game, even scores like 1000 can be submitted.
Special scores however can only be submitted if they are over the score of the hiscore table.
Special scores are for instance , 20 loops (back to the future) or 50 martians killed (attack from mars) and so on...
If you wanna go for SPECIAL SCORES the use of a new,clean nvram might be handy as you can get the scores more easy (especially helpful when trying to get a challenge)

If you have a nice score, just don't start a new game but just quit the game, PINemHi LeaderBoard will do the rest.
When quitting a game you don't have to rush , just as long as you don't start a new game the score(s) can be retrieved.

The scores are sent to the website http://pinemhi.com/
Here you can look at your scores and the scores from others and even do challenges.

It is not necessary to use a plugin for a frontend using PINemHi LeaderBoard.
There is a monitor that you start and that will monitor for activity.
You can play in a frontend or just by starting visual pinball. 
The monitor wil register your scores. 

During a game it now also is possible to see your top 10 best scores that are on pinemhi leaderboard by pressing a button
and of course special scores that you made (for example 20 loops), 
Also you can add 9 friends to see their scores as well
you can see the top 10 best score for a table from people that joined the online leaderboard
you can see the cup standings top 10 and your place in the cup
Icing on the cake, there is a badges system in place that you can bring up during gameplay to see what kind of achievements you have made ! 
More icing on the cake , there is a challenge system that you can start with a single press of a button 

Installation
------------

You can unzip the files to any folder you like, but if you use pinemhi in your frontend then it is best to put it in the same place as before.
If you have an older version of pinemhi installed then i would recommend to rename the old pinemhi.ini as you might need some data from that to put in the new pinemhi.ini file.
Copy Paste he values not the entire lines or blocks in pinemhi.ini

After that you have to adjust pinemhi.ini to your needs:
********
First up is the paths to Visual pinball and Future pinball nvrams and fprams and the Visual Pinball user path
The user path is for games that use no rom 
Set the paths and remember that the last character must be a \
********

********
After that the options for pinemhi:
replays - this shows the replays when on
hiscores - this shows the hiscores when on
buyins - this shows the buyin hiscores when on

These can all be activated together if you like of course

keys
********
key , this is the key to get the popup with the scores and or badges, it cycles on and off through the different screens
I would suggest you pick a key that is not used by visual pinball or the frontend as the key will not function during gameplay, only to show the popups of course
challengekey, this is the key to start your challenges with
weeklychallengekey, this will show the game of the week and interim scores + previous week's winner
5min_key , to enter 5 minute-mode and exit it again (only works outside of gameplay)
pinupsystem_exit_key , to let 5 minute-mode work properly with Pinup System , you need to fill in your defined exit key from Pinup System
send_button , to send your score (you don't have to quit the table)
You can also use shift-key and a key using the + , for instance +M is shift M
You can also choose joystick buttons here by the way , for instance Joy1, Joy2 etc
Not sure of course which button is which on your joystick so you will have to figure out the number yourself

only 1 of the manual offset's choices can be activated

HOW TO START
------------
For the rom-less supported games (for instance guardians of the Galaxy) to work you need to copy romsub.exe into your tables directory and add some code to the tablescripts for these tables
The rom-less code snippets can be found on http://pinemhi.com/ (also where to put the code in the script is mentioned)
If all has been filled in then you simply run the pinemhi_rom_monitor.exe and then you can start visual pinball or your frontend
You can even let the frontend start up this process everytime you start the frontend or even when you start the computer (for example in your cabinet). This way you are always insured to send the scores out you've made.

*** Badges can only be seen when someone is playing a game (key only works when a game is being played) ***
*** Challenges can only be started when no game is being played (key only works when no game is played) ***

If you make changes to pinemhi.ini you must also start pinemhi_rom_monitor again as otherwise it will not run with the changes you've made !

As a final note...
The pinemhi_rom_monitor.exe was made with AHK (autohotkey).
Microsoft Defender will frequently call AHK executables to be a virus/trojan 
This is a false positive. Feel free to test it with other anti-virus programs
There is an option in Microsoft Defender to allow the program to still be used (make an exception for that file)   


Have fun
