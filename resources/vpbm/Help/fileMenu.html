    <h3><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Refresh Menu Option</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Refresh</strong> menu option performs a full refresh of all data stored within the <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> effectively providing the same effect as re-starting the application.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Refresh</strong> menu option will not generally be required to be called but is of use if underlying game files or database settings may have been changed external to <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> while the application is running. An example of this would be the case where Pinup was used to import new games and media without having restarted <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span>.</p>
    <p>The refresh includes the following items:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Pinup Database</strong></dt>
        <dd>The underlying Pinup Database is re-queried to get a list of all installed games and enabled emulators.  Additionally the database is queried for any configured custom file filters defined for installed games, used to add additional (non-standard) files to the files associated with a game.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Installed Game Files</strong></dt>
        <dd>The file system is scanned for all game files matching configured file filters. File filters will identify game files in both the games emulator directory and the associated media and Pup Packs folders within the Pinup folder structure.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Installed Game Registry Settings</strong></dt>
        <dd>For emulators that use the registry to store information - for instance VPX, checks are done of registry settings for the specified game. These settings are extracted and stored, allowing them to be restored as part of the game restoration process.</dd>
        <dt><strong>Game Backups</strong></dt>
        <dd>The <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> backup folder structures are scanned for game backups. Backups will either match to installed games, and hence show up in the main game list, or not match live games, in which case the <strong>Import</strong> menu contains a <strong>Restore From Backup</strong> option allowing the game to be re-installed should the user  wish to.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr>


    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Settings Menu Option</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Settings</strong> menu option launches a dialog allowing users to adjust common <span class="vpbm">VPBM</span> settings. Refer to the <strong>Settings Menu</strong> section within <a href="./applicationSettings.html">Application Settings</a>. Updating settings results in the application restarting to allow setting updates to be reflected.</p>
    <hr>


    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Exit Menu Option</span></h3>
    <p>The <strong>Exit</strong> menu option is used to terminate the application. Users can alternatively close the application with the <strong>X</strong> button in the top right corner.</p>
